# lifey.llm

lifey.llm is a Streamlit web application that acts as a self-help companion using a language model and conversation memory to respond to user queries related to mental health, personal growth, relationships, and productivity.

## Features

- **API Integration**: Utilizes the Gemini API based on user input.
- **Self-Help Topic Detection**: Determines if user queries are related to self-help topics using embeddings and predefined keywords.
- **Conversation History**: Maintains a history of user interactions and AI responses using Streamlit session state.
- **Dynamic Response Display**: Expands AI responses for user review and interaction history exploration.
